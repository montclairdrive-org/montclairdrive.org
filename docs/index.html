      </div>
  <div class="content clearfix">
          <div class="node-author">Posted by <span class="username">rfay</span></div>
            <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>This policy expresses the Montclair HOA's approach to enforcement issues when they become necessary to pursue.</em></p>
<p>It was listed as a proposa from December, 2018 through June, 2019l, but was adopted as explicit policy by the Montclair HOA Board at the June 20, 2019 quarterly meeting.</p>
<p>The basis of the board’s authority to enforce is in the <a href="sites/default/files/Montclair%20covenants.pdf">covenants</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Article VII, Section 10. Rules and Regulations. Rules and regulations concerning and governing the Property or any portion thereof maybe adopted, amended or repealed, from time to time by the Board of directors of the Association and the Board of directors may establish and enforce penalties for the infraction thereof, including without limitation the levying and collecting of fines for the violation of any of such rules and regulations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Before getting to enforcement though, it’s critical to remember a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to have a functional, happy, and well-maintained neighborhood, not to use power.</li>
<li>Both before and during the process of enforcement it’s critical to have person-to-person conversations explaining what is happening if that is at all possible (and it may not always be)</li>
<li>Our basic conclusions were that we may not need to make any new specific rules at this time, but the board could choose as a whole to begin an enforcement activity The most obvious long-term struggle has been with staining fascia/soffit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a basic proposal for enforcement technique; the board can modify it as it sees fit.</p>
<p>When an enforcement action is agreed by the board:</p>
<ol>
<li>A letter explaining the problem, solution, deadline, and consequences must be sent.
<ul>
<li>If possible, a phone call or face-to-face meeting should explain the situation in person.</li>
<li><em>Contact</em>: The letter must offer a board contact that the person can talk with about the issue.</li>
<li><em>Problem</em>: Explain exactly what the problem is and why it is in conflict with our regulations or covenant/bylaws</li>
<li><em>Solution</em>: Explain exactly what must be done to resolve the problem.</li>
<li><em>Deadline(s)</em>: Explain the dates by which the solution must be achieved or the dates at which the board will contract the work done and charge it to the HOA member. This would normally be in the range of 90 days.</li>
<li><em>Consequences</em>: Explain what happens if they don’t meet the deadline. This would normally be a monthly surcharge in addition to dues. Then, if (6 months?) passes with it still not being solved, the HOA arranging the work to be done and double the contractor price and billing it as an HOA dues surcharge.</li>
<li><em>Total possible cost of non-compliance</em>: Explain the total estimated possible cost of non-compliance in the first (6?) months and then if the board has to arrange the work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the initial deadline passes, another letter must go out with all of the above reiterated (or copied) and an explanation of the new surcharge and the new deadline.</li>
<li>The treasurer is kept informed of compliance deadlines and consequences, and begins surcharge if necessary.</li>
<li>If the second deadline passes, the board arranges for the work to be done, and double the amount is passed to HOA member as a surcharge.</li>
</ol>

All payments must be sent to </span><strong style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Montclair Subdivision HOA, PO Box 812, Palisade, CO 81526</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p>

<div>If the association does not receive payment for any expense due by the date required, the delinquent member shall pay damages to reimburse the association for the overhead involved in collecting the payment as follows:</div>

<div> </div>

<div>A $30 late fee and Interest at 10% annual percentage rate from the original date due until the date the payment is received.</div>

<div>In addition to late fees, for each check from a member that a bank returns for any reason, the member must pay a $30 returned check charge. </div>

<div> </div>

<div><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The association may also refer the member's account to an attorney or collection agency for appropriate action. All fees incurred by an attorney or collection agency to recover the delinquent amounts will be assessed to the member.</span></div>

<div> </div>

<div><span style="line-height: 27px;">Before the Association turns over a delinquent account to an attorney or collection agency, the Association will send the delinquent owner a written notice specifying:</span></div>

<div> </div>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The total amount of the arrearage, with an accounting of how the total arrearage was determined;</span></li>

</ul>

<div>
	<ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">
		<li>That action is required to cure the delinquency and failure to do so within 30 days may  result in the account being turned over to a collection agency, a lawsuit being filed against the owner, the filing and foreclosure of a lien against the owner’s property and other remedies available under Colorado law. </li>
	</ul>

	<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Payment Plan</strong></p>

	<p><span style="line-height: 27px;">The Association will provide a delinquent owner with a one time opportunity to enter into a payment plan, lasting six months, to bring their delinquent account current. The delinquent owner must make the scheduled payment as required by the payment plan and remain current in the payment of current assessments. If the delinquent owners fails to make either the installment payment or the current assessment payment, the Association may immediately proceed with collections. This one-time opportunity to enter into a payment plan does not extend to owners who do not occupy the property and took title as a result of a default on a mortgage (i.e. public trustee foreclosure) or foreclosure of the Association’s lien.</span></p>

		<li class="c8 c5"><span class="c1">Keep our grounds free of dog poop.</span></li>
		<li class="c5 c8"><span class="c1">Make dog owners who do </span><span class="c1 c10">not</span><span class="c1"> clean up successfully (or the property owner) pay for the cleanup.</span></li>
	</ol>

	<p class="c2"> </p>

	<p class="c5"><span class="c1">This simple initiative has resulted in a cleaner neighborhood with much less pestering and whining about the problem.</span></p>

	<p class="c5"> </p>

	<p><strong><span class="c1">What should I do?</span></strong></p>

	<p class="c5"> </p>

	<ul>
		<li class="c5">Please pick up after your dog immediately after they poop.</li>
		<li class="c5">Please do not let your dog wander the neighborhood unattended.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="c5">Note that although we had a professional poop-pickup service in the past, we no longer have that. It is the responsibility of the dog owner to keep things picked up.</p>

	<p class="c2"> </p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">Who pays for this? </span><span class="c1">Any property that has a pickup in a given month will be fined $80.  The property owner, of course, pays the HOA dues, but may make any arrangement necessary with a renter if there is one.</span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">What if somebody else's dog poops on my property? </span><span class="c1">We'll do our level best to communicate with you and figure out which dog and which owner is the problem.  We'll ask you. If you don't have a dog and there's poop on your lawn... well, that's pretty easy. </span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4" style="text-indent: -36pt;">How much will this cost me? </span><span class="c1" style="text-indent: -36pt;">The most it could ever cost you is $80/month. If you don't have a dog it will never cost you anything.</span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">What if I have other questions? </span><span class="c1">Call or email Nancy Lewis, 970-462-7450, nancy (at) nblewis.com</span></p>
