The meeting was called to order at 7:03 pm. Board members present were: Bill and Teri Cardell, Tanya Hawkins, Randy Fay, Ray Musser and Denny Wagener. Also present were residents Wilma &amp; Jack Harbin and Ruth Young.</p>
<p>Old business (Action items from last Board Meeting):</p>
<ol>
<li>Randy will contact the attorney to arrange for an update of our Bylaws and Covenant, as approved by the membership at the annual meeting: Update: This is on Randy’s “to-do” list.</li>
<li>Randy will ask Teri and Sandy if they were able to get the thank-you sent to John and Vicky. Update: A thank you gift containing a variety of dried fruits from Alida’s and a bottle of wine from Mesa Park vineyards was sent to Vickie Miller and John Baker.</li>
<li>This year we should add a line item for landscape improvement. Update: This was done.</li>
<li>Tanya will make sure that Vicky's signing authority is removed at the bank. Update: This was done.</li>
<li>Tanya will teach Teri the Secretary duties. Update: This was done.</li>
<li>Denny will make sure the concrete waste behind 872 is gone. Update: This was done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Treasurer's Report: Tanya presented the Treasurer's Report (i.e., Balance Sheet and Profit &amp; Loss), attached, which was accepted.</p>
<p>New business:</p>
<p>1) Landscape problems for Wilma &amp; Jack Harbin are: (1) They have a hole at the end of their driveway where the concrete has broken away (2) there are spaces between the driveway and the street gutter in several places and (3) their drip system doesn't work well. All Board members looked at the problems areas before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>2) Landscaping issue for Ruth Young: there are several dead bushes that are due to winter kill on her property she would like removed. All Board members looked at the problems areas before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>3) We need to ensure we have landscaping improvements in the budget line item for 2014. Ray obtained a quote from Ed for $2300 to make some landscaping repairs. Some of the grass issues may be winter-kill. It's possible to repair it with seeding on top, but the general consensus is to wait for the grass to grow back.</p>
<p>4) The willow trees in the front and in back of Kathy O'Shana's house should be removed.</p>
<p>5) Another major landscaping problem lies behind Walt Smith’s house.</p>
<p>6) Randy Fay attended a HOA meeting recently and came back with the following suggestion: Our HOA should have more than one year's budget set aside, but our liabilities are much less so we may not need that much at present. Our complex is getting older so we can expect more expenses in maintenance yearly.</p>
<p>7) The Montclair HOA is now listed with the Secretary of State's real estate department.</p>
<p>8) Landscaping maintenance issues: There is a problem with Todd in that he hasn't started to trim yet. Traditionally when Todd hasn't had to cut lawns for a week, those hours have been applied to trimming shrubs and bushes. This doesn't seem to be working this year, as Todd "forgets".  The consensus seems to be that Todd should be doing all the landscape maintenance without Ed's involvement, but we had chosen Ed to do the sprinklers, etc because he was less expensive than Todd. We need to resolve with Todd that he is responsible for the trimming, explicitly in writing. Who checks the sprinkler heads to ensure they are all working? Ed doesn't have a reason to be here weekly and it takes numerous calls to get him to come. We don't have a contract with Ed so perhaps we should ask Todd to do all the work. A proposal was made and accepted to let Todd take over all the landscaping and irrigation problems. Ray will contact Todd about doing the work needed on a contractual basis.</p>
<p>9) Landscape request: Jacob Clark @ 824 requested permission to remove gravel and to add paving stones to make a 10 x 10 patio. A motion was made by Randy Ray to approve the proposal and the Board approved this motion. See attached request.</p>
<p>10) Irrigation Pipe meeting: A meeting is scheduled for Monday, June 17th with Merritt and Denny Wagener and Randy Fay @ 4:00 pm to discuss replacing  the irrigation pipe with Merritt. Merritt says original development plans show the irrigation pipe should be Palisade's responsibility. Denny says flooding problems started when Grand Valley Irrigation regraded the embankment to the canal.</p>
<p>The next Board meeting will be Thursday, September 12th.</p>
<p>The meeting was adjourned at 8:21 pm.</p>
