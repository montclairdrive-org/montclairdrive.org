Board members in attendance were Randy Fay, Ray Musser, Tanya Hawkins and Duke Cox. Also in attendance were HOA members Vicki Miller (Treasurer), John Baker, Nancy Lewis, Ruth Young and potential new board member Susan Lasley.<br />
John showed the board members a few areas of concern around the subdivision.<br />
1.  Erosion at the retaining wall at the drainage site along with debris prohibiting proper drainage.<br />
2.  Several dead trees in the common area. Possible replacement ideas included red wood trees or Susan suggested blue ash. John was given the information that it will cost approximately $250 for tree removal and the board has already budgeted for this expense in landscape replacement.<br />
3.  There are some bushes at Cathy O’Shana’s residence that is obstructing sidewalks and visibility issues to the south of her driveway. John suggested removing the bushes while other members thought major trimming may solve the problem.<br />
4.  Dry spots in the grass north of 857, 847 and at 837.<br />
5.  An unplanned tree is coming up at 837 near the driveway. John Baker suggested we remove the tree while Ruth Young and Ray Musser suggested letting the tree grow but pruning it back significantly at the bottom.<br />
6.  Shrubs behind 825 are extremely overgrown and John Baker feels they should be removed or seriously trimmed back while the home owners do not want to address them. The board will try to work with the homeowners to come up with a compromise.<br />
7.  There is a cottonwood that is at the north edge of Duke Cox’s property and needs to be removed.<br />
8.  There is significant weed growth in the rocks to the west of Duke Cox’s property.<br />
9.  The fence west of Duke Cox’s property and adjacent the holding pond needs to be stained.<br />
10. Many of the units need to address the trim and fascia that is fading and warping. Duke suggested that homeowners also inspect gutters for correct drainage which could be causing a lot of the damage.  Tanya will create a list of units and send out a letter to inform homeowners.<br />
John Baker agreed to manage the landscape maintenance list. The board will prioritize the list of projects to be completed. John will discuss items with the board members on a need to basis. The first two items to be addressed are:<br />
1.  Replacing the trees. This item has been budgeted for and can be addressed immediately.<br />
2.  John will inquire about the retaining wall at the drainage site and what needs to be done to repair it.<br />
Randy would like Ray Musser to follow up on the concrete work that needs to be done around the sub-division. Ray and Duke will try to coordinate trip charges to get the concrete at a cheaper rate. Tanya will get Ray the sidewalk study that was done by Nancy Lewis approximately 2 years ago.<br />
Treasurers Report - $17,091.82 in the reserve account and $9,423.37 in the checking account. Vicki also reported that there are no property owners that are delinquent on dues. The board agreed to move $6,220.00 (budgeted for the reserve account) to the reserve account. Vicki will make the transfer.<br />
Vicki reported that she receives notes and questions from HOA members when they pay their dues. Randy has asked that Vicki forward those messages to the board members so they can be responded to in a timely manner and not wait until a board meeting to address those issues. Tanya will respond to a request from a unit regarding paying lower HOA dues because of the size of their surrounding common area.<br />
Board members voted unanimously to elect Susan Lasley as a new board member.<br />
John Baker reported on the initial xeriscape plan with Bookcliff gardens. The landscape architect contacted would need to survey the entire sub-division at a cost of 8-10k. After the initial survey was complete he would work with the landscape committee to work in stages of the project or on a month to month basis. Each visit would cost $500. The proposal was budgeted and cost the HOA $200.<br />
The board agreed that for such a major expense it would need a majority vote from the members and should be conducted at the annual meeting. The board will create a budget with the xeriscape survey costs included and a budget not including the survey. Susan suggested we upload photos of similar xeriscape plans on the website for members to view. The board agreed that xeriscape may not be the correct term for the landscape plan and that grass would still be included therefore we should refer to the project as a comprehensive subdivision landscape plan.  Vicki will help to write a letter to send to each homeowner prior to our annual meeting explaining the board’s proposal.<br />
Vicki proposed that the board contact Xcel energy to possibly place solar panels in the subdivision.<br />
Ruth Young proposed an improvement to her property by adding a sidewalk to the south of her unit for easier access along with a cedar and screened wall as a sun barrier. The board approved the sidewalk addition unanimously but the current proposal to add a cedar and screened wall to block sun from her garage was not approved. Duke will suggest a type of sun barrier that better suits the continuity of the subdivision.<br />
Randy gave the report from the company Oopsy Poopsy, that was hired to pick up dog poop around the sub-division on a weekly basis. There have been a few units that have been given a fine and Randy has been diligently working to find the offending dogs and dog owners. The board members noticed a lot of dog feces on the back sides of the units and Randy explained he only requested Oopsy Poopsy to focus on the front of the units. Randy will negotiate to have Oopsy Poopsy pick up behind all units also.<br />
The board discussed coordinating the annual block party for August 19th.<br />
The next HOA board meeting was scheduled for Thursday, September 20th, 2012.<br />
The meeting was adjourned at 9:08pm.</p>
