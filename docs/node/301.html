Discussion of dog bags and payments; Linda bought bags and she could be reimbursed.  Gene asked if Bookcliff has additional work for 2023, and do we owe them any additional money.  Per Randy we have some additional expenses.  Ray responded that they have Fall cleanup, and bush trimming.  Gene also asked if bushes had been trimmed.  Nancy L. and Ray explained what bushes had been trimmed.  Ray mentioned that if anyone wanted roses trimmed perfectly, one may have to do some additional trimming.  City cleans off leaves from street once a week until they are gone. Tim Laudick checked pump house, and he found detached panels from metal posts.  This was repaired by Tim &amp; Ray including re-screwing fence, and they also re-stained the whole fence.  Gene asked what we do with $7K projected to be remaining at the end of the year.  Randy suggested that we could vote and move to approve at least 75% of this money to Reserve Account.</p>

<p>Status on Projects:<br />
•   Tim Laudick:  Discuss/Approve 830-832 Montclair Curbing Quote – Tim needs to think this should be under Capital Improvements; $1,000-Completed and adding to 2024 Budget list.<br />
•   Nancy Lewis:  Trees to remove and haul off - Discuss T4/Handyman Quotes – Completed per Nancy Lewis.<br />
•   Nancy Lewis &amp; Ray Musser:  To check on any small branches to be trimmed that are not on the schedule – Nancy said no more money for 2023, and recommends we add to budget in 2024.  Probably need a quote from T4 per Nancy.  Ray said we did get a bid to trim all for $7,000, and we only did a portion for $1,600.  Linda suggested we look at additional bids in the future.  Tim suggested T4 finish trimming this year with $ left for 2023, so that we can get them all on a cycle.  Nancy says T4 has records of what has been trimmed.  Ray recommends we get a quote from T4 for additional trimming and explore if they do this work this year or next Spring – Nancy L. will get a quote from T4, and Ray will obtain an additional quote.<br />
•   Ray Musser &amp; Tim Laudick:  Adding sand to the cracks in both alley ways.  Ray purchased 5-gallon bucket of crack-filling compound and sand – he tested this on one crack at his unit.  He thinks it did a good job and he used about 25% of a 5-gallon bucket.  He said most other cracks are larger and wants to get a proposal from an asphalt company to fix the cracks.  Tim will get the bids.</p>
