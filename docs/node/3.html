<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1. John Baker, the president,  called the meeting to order at 4:00pm. The Members were welcomed to  the meeting and thanked them for attendance. The signatures and proxy  forms were counted. There were 12 members present and 9 proxy forms.<b> </b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. John Baker read the 2009  Annual Meeting minutes. The minutes were approved by the Members. The  motion was made by Walt Smith (837) and 2<sup>nd</sup> by Duke Cox (818),  the motion passed unanimously. John Baker welcomed our new neighbors  Randy Fay and Nancy Lewis (848). He also introduced the current Board  members. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3. Treasurer Vickie Miller  reviewed the 2009 Profit &amp; Loss statement and the current Balance  Sheet. The current checking account balance is $7526.05. A money market  account was recently opened for the ‘capitol reserve fund’ and the  current balance is $7000.00. Vickie reported that collections are going  well. A motion was made by Cathy O’Shana (865) and 2<sup>nd</sup>  by Randy Fay (848) to except the 2010 treasurer’s report. The motion  passed unanimously.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4. John Baker and Renee Edel  explained to the Members that the Board was currently getting bids for  the landscape maintenance. It is the intension of the Board to hire  Ed Stehlin to oversee the irrigation in the neighborhood this summer  and then have an additional company responsible for the mowing, fertilizing,  and weeding. The irrigation has been a problem in the past and hopefully  having Ed Stehlin involved will decrease the problems with the system.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5. John Baker and Duke Cox  explained the long history of problems with the irrigation pump in detail.  The current plan is to have the ‘Pump Man’ assess the system as  soon as the water is turned on in the spring. No repairs are possible  until the water is available. There is money in the budget to replace  the motor and/or the control panel for the pump if needed. There is  also money in the budget to clean the pond of weeds in the spring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was explained that the pump  was not working for 3 weeks last June and there were problems again  in the fall. The pump’s unreliability is what delayed replacing shrubs  and grass last fall.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6. The members talked in great  detail about a possible 5 year plan to change the neighborhood landscaping  to xeriscaping. This would save water and decrease stress on the pump.  After much discussion the members want the Board to explore the possibility  of a ‘master plan’ from CSU or a local nursery. The Board will initiate  this process at the next Board meeting. Nancy Lewis (848) brought up  the idea of a community vegetable garden. Other members seemed interested  and Nancy confirmed she would be involved in the process.</font> <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7. John Baker brought up the  on-going problem of dog waste in the neighborhood. Dave Hull (832) said  Members can call Pat Meyers with the Town of Palisade at 464-5602 and  report problems with dog waste and leash laws.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8. John Baker, Renee Edel,  and Vickie Miller reviewed the 2010 Budget. The Budget was approved  by the Members. The motion was made by Dave Hull (832) and 2<sup>nd</sup>  by Randy Fay (848), the motion passed unanimously. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9. Sharon Hytenin (805) asked  about the Bylaws. It was explained that the Board hired attorney Joe  Croker to file the Homeowners Association with the State of Colorado  and complete any other legal registration/ paperwork. Mr. Croker told  the Board that each Member is to sign a certificate which will be held  with the Bylaws. Randy Fay (848) said he would create a website for  the HOA where Bylaws, minutes, treasurer reports, etc. can be posted.  The Members were very thankful and approved of a website.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10. Randy Fay (848) reported  that he was told that the Covenants are not clear on whose responsibility  it is for example if a fire in one unit spread to an adjoining unit.  He requested that the Board have a ‘formal statement’ regarding  everyone’s liability with their units so that each Member’s responsibility  is understood. A real-estate attorney is probably the best person to  hire for this legal statement. Randy also requested that the Board address  the issue of snow removal and make each Member aware of their responsibility.  The Board will address these issues at the next meeting.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11. There was a long discussion  started by Duke Cox (818) regarding another neighborhood close by that  was sold to a ‘housing resource group’. After much discussion Dave  Hull (832), who is on the town council for Palisade, recommended that  the Members not be concerned at this time because the Town of Palisade  has a very defensible legal position.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12. John Baker informed the  Members that 3 Board members needed to be elected. Randy Fay (848),  Sharon Hytenin (805), Tonya Hawkins (861), and Nancy Lewis (848) were  all properly nominated for the elections. The Members voted by secret  ballot and the results were counted by non-member Charlene Weidner.  Randy and Tanya both received 16 votes, Sharon received 15, and Nancy  received 13 votes. The new Board members are Randy Fay, Sharon Hytenin,  and Tonya Hawkins.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13. The meeting was adjourned  at 7:00pm. </font> <br />
